ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Added Colour.
I used midnight purple for the background, hot pink for the enemies and enemies’ bombs, medium purple for the buildings, and white for the helicopter and helicopter’s bombs. 

2. Scoring.
I kept score of the number of enemies destroyed.

3. Game Resize.
I allow the user to resize the window anytime that the game is opened (including during gameplay).
I also disable users to resize the window height lower than 400 and the window width lower than 600 so that objects can be drawn properly.

4. Extra Life.
I drop stars that give +1 Life to the helicopter.
